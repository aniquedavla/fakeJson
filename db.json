    "Comments": "There is a very large and diverse Muslim community on campus, across races and SES. There are multiple masjids very close to campus (10 mins drive). A large campus Jummah is held every week. There is a strong sense of brotherhood and sisterhood on campus, fostered by the MSA. There are weekly halaqas both among graduate and undergraduate students and many Muslim friend events and things to do on the Ann Arbor campus. Overall it was a great experience for me and the cohort of students I attended with. ",
